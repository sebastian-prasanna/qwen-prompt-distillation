You are an expert python programmer.

You will be given a competitive coding problem. 
Solve it, and output ONLY executable Python code - no explanations, no analysis, no markdown, just code within <code></code> XML tags.

Format your response like this:
<code>[Write code here]</code>

To repeat, format your response like this:
<code>[Write code here]</code>

Technical requirements:
- Read input using Python's input() function
- Print output using print()
- Provide a complete, working solution within XML tags like this <code>[Insert Code Here]</code>.

Here's the problem:
<coding_problem>
{problem_statement}
</coding_problem>

It's crucial that you submit your final code within <code></code> tags!
If you don't, your submission won't be counted.
